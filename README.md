Scraping Workshop
===

This is a workshop that teaches how to use Python to create a dataset by scraping a website.

This entails parsing HTML, downloading PDFs, and extracting data from PDFs.

## Installation

Install JupyterLab if necessary (you can use a virtual environment).
I set this up with `Python3.10`.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run the `jupyter-lab` server.

## Running the workshop

Just open the notebook in JupyterLab, it explains everything.

## Backups

It's possible the source website will change or disappear entirely.
It's archived in the `bak/web` directory.
All the PDFs that should be downloaded are in `bak/raw`.
A sample "final product" CSV is also included in the `bak/data` directory.
